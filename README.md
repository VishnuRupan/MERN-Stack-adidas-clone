## Overview
The goal for this project was to develop a full stack application using React and Redux. One of the most common full stack applications on the internet are e-commerce websites. I decided to re-create the adidas website and implement the features most useful in e-commerce stores. This was a project to help solidify my knowledge using Redux in React and backend authentication.
